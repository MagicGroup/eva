/**
 * Provides an easy to use C++ implementation of RSA's
 * MD5 algorithm.
 *
 * The default constructor is designed to provide much the same
 * functionality as the most commonly used C-implementation, while
 * the other three constructors are meant to further simplify the
 * process of obtaining a digest by calculating the result in a
 * single step.
 *
 * TQMD5 is state-based, that means you can add new contents with
 * update() as long as you didn't request the digest value yet.
 * After the digest value was requested, the object is "finalized"
 * and you have to call reset() to be able to do another calculation
 * with it.  The reason for this behaviour is that upon requesting
 * the message digest TQMD5 has to pad the received contents up to a
 * 64 byte boundary to calculate its value. After this operation it
 * is not possible to resume consuming data.
 *
 * @sect Usage:
 *
 * A common usage of this class:
 *
 * <PRE>
 *  const char* test1;
 *  TQMD5::Digest rawResult;
 *
 *  test1 = "This is a simple test.";
 *  TQMD5 context (test1);
 *  cout << "Hex Digest output: " << context.hexDigest().data() << endl;
 * </PRE>
 *
 * To cut down on the unnecessary overhead of creating multiple TQMD5
 * objects, you can simply invoke @ref reset() to reuse the same object
 * in making another calculation:
 *
 * <PRE>
 *  context.reset ();
 *  context.update ("TWO");
 *  context.update ("THREE");
 *  cout << "Hex Digest output: " << context.hexDigest().data() << endl;
 * </PRE>
